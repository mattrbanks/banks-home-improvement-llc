          After working for the past 15 years as an educator and getting laid
          off during the Covid crisis in June of 2020, I decided to start my own
          home cleaning, maintaining, and landscaping business. I have more than
          25 years experience in home maintenance work. I worked part time for
          Mark's Landscaping (Mark Alley, proprietor) where I have done
          landscaping, leaf removal, trimming, and property clean-ups nearly
          every summer, in addition to snow removal in the winters. I have also
          worked as a tree removal technician for R&R Tree Service (Robert Roy,
          proprietor) part time for the past twelve years, where I have removed
          trees, chipped wood, and trimmed trees as well. I have moving and
          cleaning experience inside through moving people privately part time
          for the past 25 years and from assisting with tag sales in the
          community. I am an expert packer, cleaner, organizer, and property
          stager through multiple work experiences for the past two decades. I
          would be happy to assess your needs and give you a fair and equitable
          quote for my services. Your happiness is my success.
